Just me trying to learn some Object-Oriented PHP

Overview:

- Not sure where I'm going with this, just want to practice my OOP with PHP skills.
- I'm fairly new to Object-oriented PHP so feel free to edit my code and give me some feedback/tips
- Thinking about making a database application for this.
